## 📌 AI Lab Assignment

**Interactive Game AI – Tic-Tac-Toe System using Adversarial Search Algorithms**

---

## 🧠 Problem Description

A gaming system requires an intelligent opponent capable of making optimal decisions in a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Traditional rule-based approaches lack strategic depth. This project implements an AI-based solution using **Minimax Algorithm** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to ensure optimal gameplay.

The AI evaluates all possible moves and always selects the best one, making it **unbeatable**.

---

## 🌐 System Overview

This is a **web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** where a human player competes against an AI.

The system also provides **real-time comparison** between two algorithms:

* ⏱ Execution Time
* 🌳 Nodes Explored
* ⚡ Performance Efficiency

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

* **Game Engine (ai.py)**
  Implements Minimax and Alpha-Beta algorithms

* **Web Server (app.py)**
  Flask backend handling routes and APIs

* **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**
  Interactive UI for gameplay

* **Comparison Module**
  Displays algorithm performance metrics

---

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used

### 🔹 Minimax Algorithm

* Explores all possible game states
* Assumes opponent plays optimally
* Selects best move

**Evaluation Scores:**

* Win → +10
* Draw → 0
* Loss → -10

---

### 🔹 Alpha-Beta Pruning

* Optimized version of Minimax
* Skips unnecessary branches
* Faster decision making
* Same optimal result

---

## ✨ Features

* 🎯 Unbeatable AI Opponent
* 🔄 Two AI Modes (Minimax & Alpha-Beta)
* 📊 Real-Time Algorithm Comparison
* ⏱ Execution Time Measurement
* 🌳 Nodes Explored Visualization
* 🎮 Interactive Web Interface
* 🔗 API-based Backend Integration

## 🧪 Sample Gameplay

### Example Game Flow

- Player chooses: X  
- AI chooses: O  

Move sequence:
- Player → Position 0  
- AI → Position 4 (optimal center move)  
- Player → Position 8  
- AI → Blocks winning path  

### Result:
Draw (Optimal play from both sides)

### Performance:
- Minimax: High node exploration  
- Alpha-Beta: Reduced nodes (~95% less)  
- Faster decision making with same result

---
## 📊 Key Observations

- Alpha-Beta Pruning significantly reduces the number of nodes explored  
- Both algorithms always return the same optimal move  
- Alpha-Beta is faster due to pruning of unnecessary branches  
- Minimax explores the complete game tree  
- The AI ensures either a win or a draw (never loses)  
---
## 🎮 Demo Walkthrough

1. Open the application in your browser  
2. Choose your symbol (X or O)  
3. Click on any cell to make your move  
4. The AI instantly responds with the optimal move  
5. View real-time comparison:
   - Nodes explored
   - Execution time
   - Algorithm used  
6. Continue playing until win, loss, or draw  

The AI guarantees optimal gameplay, making it impossible to defeat.
